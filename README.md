TNT Clock – Smart IoT-Based Clock for Alarms, Reminders, and Lighting Control
TNT Clock is an innovative IoT project that seamlessly integrates hardware and software to deliver a modern, connected clock experience. Powered by the ESP32 microcontroller and connected to a companion mobile app, TNT Clock goes far beyond telling time—offering smart features for alarm management, reminder notifications, ambient lighting control, and online synchronization.

Key Features:
Real-Time Synchronization
The clock syncs with online time servers to ensure accurate timekeeping without manual adjustments.

Smart Alarm & Reminder System
Users can set multiple alarms and reminders through the mobile app. These are transmitted to the ESP32 device over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for real-time activation.

Ambient Lighting Control
Integrated RGB LEDs allow dynamic lighting features, including wake-up lights, notification indicators, and customizable themes, controlled directly from the app.

Mobile App Connectivity
The custom mobile application provides an intuitive interface for managing time, alarms, and lighting modes. It maintains a constant connection with the ESP32 for live updates and remote control.

Custom Clock Design
Encased in a clock-shaped body, TNT Clock blends classic aesthetics with smart functionality, making it ideal for bedrooms, workspaces, or modern home setups.

Technology Stack:
Hardware: ESP32, RGB LEDs, buzzer/speaker module, RTC module (optional for backup)

Software: Flutter (or preferred framework) mobile app, ESP32 firmware (C++/Arduino), Firebase or MQTT (optional for cloud sync)
